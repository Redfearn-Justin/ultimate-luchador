1. delete/rename your current master repo 
2. re-clone the new repo (as of 11/10 afternoon)
3. cd into the repo in your terminal
4. run "yarn install"
5. run "npm i"
6. cd into /client
7. run "npm i"

***

8. now go over to mysql workbench
9. right click on your luchador_db schema and "drop schema"
10. re-schema using our "schema.sql" file
11. re-seed our test character using our "seeds.sql" file
12. re-seed our NPC characters using our "150seeds.sql" file (just paste it all into workbench and run it)

13. cd back to the parent folder
14. run "yarn start" - the app will open on localhost:3000
