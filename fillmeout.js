// --- LUCHADOR NAMES
// We need to populate as many random names as possible for NPCs. 
// Names MUST be between 7-16 characters, and they can contain spaces. Some random ones I came up with were "El Loco Rojo", "Megatron", and "The Machine".
// Populate this array with ~20 random Luchador/player names:
var characterNames = [""];

// --- COMMENTATOR PHRASES: FORMAT
// Commentator phrases are formatted as follows:  "WOAH," ____ "USED THE ATTACK" ____!
// They may also follow that phrase up with a random comment, like "THAT WILL HURT IN THE MORNING!"
// We are only creating phrases for the three phrases in quotes. 

// --- COMMENTATOR PHRASE 1: SURPRISE
// The first thing they will say is a reaction to the attack. THE NEXT WORD WILL BE THE CHARACTER'S NAME. Here are some basic examples:
// "WOAH,"   "HOLY COW,"   "ALL OF A SUDDEN"  "MR. "   "AHHHH"
// Populate this array with AT LEAST 10 random 'surprise' reactions that will come before the character's name:
var surpriseText = [""];

// --- COMMENTATOR PHRASE 2: DESCRIPTION
// The second thing they will say after the character's name is a description of what they did. THE NEXT WORD WILL BE THE CHARACTER'S ATTACK. Here are some basic examples:
// "USED THE ATTACK"   "PUMMELED THEIR OPPONENT WITH"   "SHOOK THE FLOOR WITH"  "EXPLODED THE NIPS OF THE AUDIENCE WITH THE"   "SHIT THE BED WITH"
// Populate this array with AT LEAST 10 random 'description' reactions that will come after the character's name:
var descriptionText = [""];

// --- COMMENTATOR PHRASE 3: RANDOM QUIPS
// Finally, they might say something weird randomly. These messages will appear between attacks, and rarely.
// Imagine the commentator saying something off-the-cuff in a random, commentator-y way. Some random examples:
// "IN MY 85 YEARS COMMENTATING IVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT" "IM GONNA NEED NEW UNDERWEAR AFTER THAT ONE!" "I HEARD THEY LEARNED THAT MOVE IN 'NAM"
// Populate this array with AT LEAST 10 random 'quips':
var quipText = [""];
